            About The Ministry Of Altar Server
        </h1>

        <p>
            “The altar server has a privileged place in liturgical celebrations. Those who serve at Mass present themselves to a community. They experience from close at hand that Jesus Christ is present and active in every liturgy,” John Paul said.

            “In the liturgy, you are far more than mere ‘helpers of the parish priest’. Above all, you are servants of Jesus Christ, the eternal High Priest.”

            Any child who has received the sacraments of baptism and First Holy Communion in the Catholic Church can be an altar server. It is a great opportunity for them to grow in their faith and become more active in the Church.

            Just as you involve your child in activities at home — whether it’s setting the table for supper or tidying up the kitchen together after—inviting your child to join in activities at church, such as becoming an altar server, will help them increase in skill and interest.

            The sanctuary is very sacred, and serving there requires the utmost respect. To be an altar server requires discipline and conscientiousness.
        
            Your child will have to pay more attention to the whole Mass to help remember sequences, and will also learn to follow instructions. Altar servers have to pay attention as to when to give the wine and hosts, ring the bell, or process back to the entrance of the church.

            The discipline and attention to detail which a child learns as an altar sever provides valuable skills they need to become responsible adults.

"From all eternity God chose with infinite wisdom the woman who would be the Mother of His divine Son. To prepare for the Word Incarnate a spotless and holy tabernacle, God created Mary in grace and endowed her from the moment of her conception with all the perfections suited to her exalted dignity. St. Thomas teaches that through her intimacy with Christ, the principle of grace, she possessed beyond all creatures a fullness of divine life." — Liturgical Meditations, The Sisters of St. Dominic</p>

              <p class="card-text">Today the Church celebrates all the saints: canonized or beatified, and the multitude of those who are in heaven enjoying the beatific vision that are only known to God. During the early centuries the Saints venerated by the Church were all martyrs. Later on the Popes set November 1 as the day for commemorating all the Saints. We all have this "universal call to holiness." What must we to do in order to join the company of the saints in heaven? We "must follow in His footsteps and conform [our]selves to His image seeking the will of the Father in all things. [We] must devote [our]selves with all [our] being to the glory of God and the service of [our] neighbor. In this way, the holiness of the People of God will grow into an abundant harvest of good, as is admirably shown by the life of so many saints in Church history" (Lumen Gentium, 40).</p>

              <p class="card-text">The month of November is dedicated to the Souls in Purgatory, whose feast is celebrated on November 2. With the exception of the last two days, the entire month of November falls during the liturgical season known as Ordinary Time, which is represented by the liturgical color green. This symbol of hope is the color of the sprouting seed and arouses in the faithful the hope of reaping the eternal harvest of heaven, especially the hope of a glorious resurrection. It is used in the offices and Masses of Ordinary Time. The last portion of the liturgical year represents the time of our pilgrimage to heaven during which we hope for reward. The last Sunday, which marks the beginning of Advent, the liturgical color changes to purple, representing a time of penance.</p>
